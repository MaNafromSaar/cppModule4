# C++ Inheritance, Polymorphism, Deep Copying, and Memory Management

This setup ensures that the appropriate destructors are called in the expected order, and it demonstrates the uniqueness of each animal's Brain.

Function prints are largely commented out but can be activated to track proceedings.

The exercise is designed to demonstrate concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, deep copying, and memory management in C++.

It may seem unintuitive to create 100 instances of a class with derived classes where the only distinguishing feature is a random array of strings and their place in memory. Adding names and additional features would have been overkill for this exercise. Instead, each animal is provided with a Brain that can be used for checks.
