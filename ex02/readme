# C++, Polymorphism, Abstract Class, Not Instantiable

By declaring 

```cpp
virtual void makeSound() const = 0;
```

the `Animal` class becomes abstract and cannot be instantiated directly. Any class that inherits from `Animal` must provide an implementation for the `makeSound` function.

I left the tests and pseudoclasses from ex00 in to demonstrate different behavior during evaluation.
